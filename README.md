# MsDetector
This is a tool for finding microsatellites
This needs HMMLib (https://github.com/tttamaki/HMMLib) and the Boost library (https://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost/1.47.0/).
The makefile will need to have IDIR and LDIR point to the HMMLib and Boost libraries.
Alternatively, executables are included in exec/.
